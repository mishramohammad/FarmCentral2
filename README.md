Farm Central

Farm Central aims to manage Farmers associated with the site, as well as the 
company Employees that assist them.

Description:
• This website was created for Farmers and Employees, providing a login 
and register page for each user. 
• Farmers can add products.
• Employees have been enabled to add any new farmers to the database.

Technologies:
Visual Studio 2022 and ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View Controller) was implemented for this app, with the use of Views and Razor pages. 
Programming language C# is used as well and been referenced accordingly. 
To create the connecting database, Microsoft SQL Server Management was used.

Issues:
• The login and register page were a bit tedious to work with, in terms of code and individual user-authentication.
• Each user to login separately, as well, was challenging. 

Installation:
• Ensure Visual Studio 2022 is installed.
• Cross-check your system requirements with the app’s download site.
• Ensure Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 or MySQL Workbench is installed to view the database script.

App:
• Contains a login/register feature to allow existing users to sign in, or new 
users to sign up, via the employees or company.
• The home page includes tabs to Employee, Products, Farmers and 
Privacy Policy pages.
• The Employee page displays the logged in employees and allows them to 
add Farmers to the database.
• The Products page is relevant to Farmers that wish to add new products 
to their production.
• The Farmers tab shows each farmer currently on the database and
allows for more to be added.
• The Privacy Policy page adheres to the company’s privacy policy.
